knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

# The code chunk named css includes all the css for this page. It's exported to all the SUS app, so everything in that css chunk should be starting by '.meet_the_team', so that it's applied only in the content of this script. 'meet_the_team' is the name of the divs' class used here. Every other code chunk which is the presentation for each individual team member should be preceded by '<div class="meet_the_team">' and ended with '</div>' to indicate that every code chunk is a new div, with the 'meet_the_team' css class taken.
